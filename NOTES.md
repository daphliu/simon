I approached the problem by writing all the neccesary behaviors the problem requires on a piece of paper. I grouped them into methods and established relationships between them.

The general difficulty was the fact that I did not know Javascript. I first wrote out the problem in Java, then learned to convert it. I learned equivalent methods, such as clearing a list and using maps. Google was my best friend!

One thing I found difficult was waiting between notes. I learned different ways to pause using "setTimeout" and decided on using new async functions because they were easy to read and write.

Playing the "easy task" instead:
Rename "js/simon-echo.js" to "js/simon.js" and refresh the page.
